# Email-Spam-Classifier

Project Report: Email Spam Classifier

1. Introduction
The goal of this project was to build an email spam classifier using machine learning techniques. The project involved several stages, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and improvement. The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle.

2. Data Cleaning
The first step in the project was to perform data cleaning. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring the dataset was in a suitable format for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After cleaning the data, we conducted EDA to gain insights into the dataset. We analyzed the distribution of spam and non-spam emails, explored the characteristics of spam emails (such as length, subject lines, etc.), and visualized the data using plots and charts.

4. Text Preprocessing
To prepare the text data for modeling, we performed various preprocessing techniques. This included tokenization, removing stop words, removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and applying stemming or lemmatization.

5. Model Building
We built several machine learning models for the email spam classification task. The models used included:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
AdaBoost
Bagging
Extra Trees
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost (Voting Classifier)
6. Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the models, we split the dataset into training and testing sets. We used evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance. We also used techniques like cross-validation to validate the model's performance across different folds of the data.

7. Improvement
Based on the evaluation results, we observed that the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) model achieved the highest accuracy for the email spam classification task. To further improve the model's performance, we experimented with parameter tuning, feature selection, and ensemble techniques.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we successfully built an email spam classifier using machine learning techniques. The project involved data cleaning, EDA, text preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and improvement. The Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) model emerged as the best-performing model for this task. The project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection in achieving accurate email spam classification.
